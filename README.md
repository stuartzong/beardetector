# Training a mutation classifier & Creating a Web App
## igvReader: classify a IGV screenshot to be positive or negative for a variant  

The following were used for model **training** (see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)):    
- fastai:  version 1.0.42
- PyTorch:  version  1.0.0
- Python:  version 3.6

The following were used for model **deployment**:    
- Heroku
- Flask:  version 1.0
